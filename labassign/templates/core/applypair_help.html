    <h1>Apply pair help</h1>
    <p>
        Labs will be done working in pairs (two students).
        You may choose your partner using the "apply pair" option
        in the menu. Students that are members of the same "pair" will be
        assigned to the same group.

        <h4> How to create a Pair?</h4>
        <p>
            The process requires the active participation of both members of the pair.
            Let us image that María and Pedro want to work together. First Maria needs to
            log into the system and apply for a pair selecting Pedro as partner. After
            that Pedro needs to log into the system and apply for a pair selecting
            María as partner. At this point the pair is validated and will be taken into account
            in the group select process.

                just select "break pair" and follow the instructions.
